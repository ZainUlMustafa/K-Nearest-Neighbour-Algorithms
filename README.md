# K-Nearest-Neighbour-Algorithms
KNN algorthm using SKlearn and without using SKlearn application on few datasets available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html

This is a code for testing the extent, functionality, accuracy, and confidence of K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm. Few datasets are provided
in the repo so you can just simply download the repo and use it in your IDE.

I normally use Eclipse IDE for my Python code on Windows because it's free and easy to use. If you're using LINUX then there is no need for
an IDE, you can just run the script directly from the terminal.

Please feel free to contact me, and do suggest me any dataset as I'm also a learner. Thank You :D
